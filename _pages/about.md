## Introduction

I have completed my PhD from [Department of Electrical Engineering](http://www2.ee.ncu.edu.tw/) at [National Central University](https://www.ncu.edu.tw/en), Taiwan (2019-2023). I have completed my Bachelor of Electrical Engineering from [Namal College](https://namal.edu.pk/), Pakistan (2011-2015), and Master of Electrical Engineering from [Department of Electrical Engineering](http://www2.ee.ncu.edu.tw/) at [National Central University](https://www.ncu.edu.tw/en), Taiwan (2016-2018). 



## Research Areas

In the past, I have worked on the low-power implementation of digital hardware designs for digital signal processing and data compression. In PhD, my research focused on On-Chip learning of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). I designed DNN algorithm for Incremental Learning (IL) such that it can be implemented on a low-power ASIC. Moreover, I explored the areas of edge-optimized incremental learning methods and transfer learning to make training possible on the edge devices without the need of sending data back to the server for training purposes.
